#COBOL History
##Introduction
To appreciate some of the features of COBOL, it is useful to understand its background. Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) was first proposed as far back as 1959. In those days each computer vendor had their own programming language. COBOL was proposed as a common language that could run on computers from different vendors such as Burroughs and Univac. It was designed to perform accounting and commercial tasks on the computers at that time, mainframes.
